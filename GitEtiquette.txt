1. Why am I contributing? Bored, want to gain skills, want to be acknowledged, want to be productive, etc can all be reasons for contributing and anything is fine because we are working for free.
2. Be polite, use thank you, please and congratulate people to nourish a good collaborative environment.
3. Choose effective contributions to make and don't make changes based on personal preference and follow the project's guidelines.
4. Always read the README.md, the provided docs and try to find solutions before asking other contributors for help. This helps gain knowledge and become independent adn also not put unnecessary burden on other contributors. But even after searching for the solution if you don't find it, feel free to ask the community.
5. Ask questions in the specified place and do not create issues and create noise in the main stream.
6. Respect the decision of the core contributors and the moderators even if it goes against our opinion.
7. Be patient, do not expect quick feedback. They assign us an issue and wait for our work, so we should also wait for them after a PR or after commenting, etc. All of us are humans afterall.

PS: In the previous PR, I read the entire MDN web doc and just asked ai to summarize it for me and then edited every line of the ai generated answer. But yes, writing it own my own does give an extra level of experience.
